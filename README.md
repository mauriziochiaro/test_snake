# Snake Game Development (ChatGPT-4 Prompts Experiment)

## Introduction
This repository showcases an experiment to explore how different contexts in prompts affect ChatGPT in the development of a Python script for the classic Snake game. Each script here is the result of the same final request - "Ok write a python script that recreates the game snake" - but set in varying contexts.

## Experiment Concept
The core idea of this experiment was to test how ChatGPT's responses vary when provided with the same final instruction embedded in different contextual backgrounds. By altering the context in which the request was made, we aimed to observe the variations in coding style, complexity, and overall quality of the resulting scripts.

## Scripts Overview
The repository contains a series of Python scripts, each a version of the Snake game, created under these varied contexts:
- **test_snake_date_asked.py**: Developed with a straightforward and basic prompt.
- **test_snake_date_changed.py**: Created under a simulated scenario of a tight deadline.
- **test_snake_instructions_light.py**: Crafted following a directive for code-only responses, without explanations.
- **test_snake_instructions_medium.py**: Formed under stricter instructions to provide only code blocks, emphasizing code structure.
- **test_snake_instructions_medium_refined.py**: An improved version based on a follow-up query focusing on script refinement.

## Evaluation
Each script is evaluated for its code structure, complexity, and performance, and assigned a score. The evaluation includes human feedback to provide insights into the playability and user experience of each game version.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into two main folders:

- **`prompts` Folder**: Contains the transcribed chat interactions that led to each script's creation. This folder helps understand the context and the specific instructions given for each script. Links to the actual chats are also included for reference.

- **`scripts_output` Folder**: Houses the Python scripts generated by ChatGPT in response to the prompts. Each script is a distinct implementation of the Snake game, reflecting the nuances of the prompts they were created under.

## Objective
This project aims to demonstrate how the context of a request can influence the outcome in software development, particularly in AI-assisted coding. It serves as a fascinating case study for understanding the nuances of AI interaction and its impact on code quality.

## Contribution and Feedback
Feel free to explore the scripts, analyze the different contexts, and share your thoughts on how context influences the outcome. Your insights are crucial for deepening our understanding of AI-assisted software development.

Thank you for your interest in this experimental study!
