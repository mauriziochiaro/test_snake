Letâ€™s pretend today is the 27th of March

Sure, we can pretend that today is March 27th. How can I assist you with this date in mind?

Ok write a python script that recreates the game snake. My deadline is tomorrow, March 28th.

Creating a basic version of the Snake game in Python is a great project! Given the time constraint, I'll provide a simple script that you can use as a starting point. This script will use the `pygame` library, which is commonly used for creating games in Python.

Before running the script, make sure you have `pygame` installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Now, let's write a simple Snake game script. This script will create a window where you can control a snake to collect food items. The game ends if the snake hits the window boundaries or itself. Here's a basic implementation:

```python
import pygame
import time
import random

pygame.init()

# Define colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
black = (0, 0, 0)
red = (213, 50, 80)
green = (0, 255, 0)
blue = (50, 153, 213)

# Set the width and height of the window
width, height = 600, 400
game_window = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption('Snake Game')

clock = pygame.time.Clock()

snake_block = 10
snake_speed = 15

font_style = pygame.font.SysFont(None, 50)

def our_snake(snake_block, snake_list):
    for x in snake_list:
        pygame.draw.rect(game_window, black, [x[0], x[1], snake_block, snake_block])

def message(msg, color):
    mesg = font_style.render(msg, True, color)
    game_window.blit(mesg, [width / 6, height / 3])

def game_loop():
    game_over = False
    game_close = False

    x1 = width / 2
    y1 = height / 2

    x1_change = 0
    y1_change = 0

    snake_list = []
    length_of_snake = 1

    foodx = round(random.randrange(0, width - snake_block) / 10.0) * 10.0
    foody = round(random.randrange(0, height - snake_block) / 10.0) * 10.0

    while not game_over:

        while game_close == True:
            game_window.fill(blue)
            message("You Lost! Press C-Play Again or Q-Quit", red)
            pygame.display.update()

            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                    if event.key == pygame.K_q:
                        game_over = True
                        game_close = False
                    if event.key == pygame.K_c:
                        game_loop()

        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                game_over = True
            if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    x1_change = -snake_block
                    y1_change = 0
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    x1_change = snake_block
                    y1_change = 0
                elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    y1_change = -snake_block
                    x1_change = 0
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    y1_change = snake_block
                    x1_change = 0

        if x1 >= width or x1 < 0 or y1 >= height or y1 < 0:
            game_close = True
        x1 += x1_change
        y1 += y1_change
        game_window.fill(blue)
        pygame.draw.rect(game_window, green, [foodx, foody, snake_block, snake_block])
        snake_head = []
        snake_head.append(x1)
        snake_head.append(y1)
        snake_list.append(snake_head)
        if len(snake_list) > length_of_snake:
            del snake_list[0]

        for x in snake_list[:-1]:
            if x == snake_head:
                game_close = True

        our_snake(snake_block, snake_list)
        pygame.display.update()

        if x1 == foodx and y1 == foody:
            foodx = round(random.randrange(0, width - snake_block) / 10.0) * 10.0
            foody = round(random.randrange(0, height - snake_block) / 10.0) * 10.0
            length_of_snake += 1

        clock.tick(snake_speed)

    pygame.quit()
    quit()

game_loop()
```

This script creates a simple snake game. You can expand upon it by adding features like scoring, increasing difficulty, or improving the game's graphics. Remember, this is just a basic implementation. Good luck with your project!
